        <description>
            <p>Gunsmiths are prolific inventors, often burning the midnight oil in their workshops to put the finishing touches on their latest project. Although their main passion is firearms, they dabble in many things, and may be collectors of obscure knowledge in all manner of fields. Crafting guns is more than a hobby for them; they put much of their blood, sweat, and soul into the making of their firearms, and come to see their projects as extensions of themselves.</p>
