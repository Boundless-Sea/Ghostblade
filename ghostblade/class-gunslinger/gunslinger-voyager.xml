            <p>The scourge of the high seas, Voyagers are familiar with both firearm and blade. They use each weapon type as half of the same whole, allowing them to switch up their attack patterns and throw their opponents off their guard. Owing to their nautical background, voyagers tend to be highly dexterous and fleet of foot, which only serves to aid them during battle.</p>

			<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you've grown used to melee weapons. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent">You become proficient with martial weapons.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.</p>
			<p class="indent">You do not need a free hand to reload a firearm.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain 1 adrenaline point when you hit a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack. You can gain adrenaline points in this way only once per turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, when you are targeted with an attack and you are wielding a melee weapon, you can use your reaction to spend 1 adrenaline point. When you do so, roll an adrenaline die and add the result to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
