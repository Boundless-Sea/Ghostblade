			<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.</p>

			<p>Your patron is a powerful being of the Upper Planes. You have bound yourself to an ancient empyrean, solar, ki-rin, or unicorn or to another entity that resides in the planes of everlasting bliss. Your pact with that being allows you to experience the barest touch of the holy light that illuminates the multiverse.</p>

You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the celestial realm of your patron, a desire to wander that paradise for the rest of your days. But you know that your mission is among mortals for now and that your pact binds you to bring light to the dark places of the world.</p>

			<p>You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell—a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.</p>
			<p class="indent">Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends. </p>

For such beings, time and morality are fleeting things, the concerns of those for whom grains of sand still rush through life’s hourglass.

They eagerly share this profane knowledge, along with other secrets, with those who work their will among the living.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, the influence of your patron allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular firearm. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one firearm that you are proficient with and designate it as your phantom firearm. Your phantom firearm has the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use that firearm as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">Attacks with your phantom firearm are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you cast an evocation spell that requires an attack roll, the spell originates from your phantom firearm. The range is still determined by the spell, and you use your spell attack modifier for the attack rolls as normal. Doing this does not expend a bullet.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can dismiss your phantom firearm (no action required), shunting it into an extradimensional space, and you can use an action to summon your phantom firearm thereafter. The phantom firearm appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when you die.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally, when you hit with a bullet from your phantom firearm, you can spend 1 adrenaline point. When you do so, roll an adrenaline die and add the result to the attack’s damage. The damage type of this extra damage is determined by your Otherworldly Patron, as shown in the Phantom Firearm table. If your patron is the Genie, you choose the damage type when you take this subclass at 3rd level.</p>
