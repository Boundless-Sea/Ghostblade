		<description>
			<p>The sun hangs low in a hazy sky. Somewhere in a steadily darkening alley, a human lifts a tiefling up by the collar and slams him against the dry oak wall. A cold steel blade pressed to his throat, the tiefling prepares for the end... Then, a shot rings out, and the knife flies spinning out of the human's hand. Cursing, the would-be killer whips around and spots a yuan-ti figure standing in the street, blowing smoke off the barrel of her gun. The bandit flees into the wilderness, and the gunslinger starts patching up the victim's injuries.</p>
			<p class="indent">Deep in a mountain ravine, a cult leader steps up to a raised dais, ready to address her followers. Just as she opens her mouth for her harangue, she crumples to the ground, silent as a stone. Chaos ensues. The cultists panic. High on a cliff, away from the action, a goliath congratulations his elven companion on another successful mark.</p>
			<p class="indent">In a heavily fortified castle, a half-orc slams the ramrod down the barrel of his flintlock. All the guards fled with their tails between their legs when the hobgoblins took the castle, and after taking down mook after mook, the half-orc prepares himself for the final assault. A room full of hostages depends on him to get this exactly right. He sighs, cocks the hammer, and stands up.</p>
			<p class="indent">Gunslingers make use of firearms, a relatively recent invention in many settings. As masters of a new technology, they have an upper hand on many opponents who have not before encountered gunpowder-based weapons. However, the hand holding the trigger is just as important as the gun itself in determining who comes out on top in battle. Strong as an ox and twice as stubborn, gunslingers pull ahead by taking heavy risks—and reaping heavy rewards.</p>      
			<h4>TRUE GRIT</h4>
			<p>Gunslingers may have powerful weapons, but that's not all they have going for them. Rather than relying on magic tricks or fancy footwork, gunslingers tend to overcome obstacles through sheer force of will, as they simply won't allow themselves to fail. They draw every last drop of vitality from their bodies, using their physical condition as a resource with which to perform daring stunts</p>
			<p class="indent">Brash as they may be, most gunslingers are truly skilled at wielding their firearms. Marksmanship is a talent they don't even seem to need to hone, making the most impeccable shots on pure instinct. Different gunslingers specialize in different styles of shooting, leaning towards whatever feels most right to them on first crack. This seems to work out pretty well for them and anyone they work with—with a gunslinger watching your six, if you hear a shot, you won't even have to turn around to know the threat is neutralized.</p>
			<h4>BRAVEHEARTS AND BRIGANDS</h4>
			<p>Not everyone who wields a gun is a gunslinger. Some use guns recreationally; others craft them for sale; and still others carry firearms for personal protection, but are not particularly adept at using them. That said, any true gunslingers in a settlement are quite easy to spot. Often they have throngs of admirers, or their deep personal convictions compel them to do great deeds for the public. Some other gunslingers, however, use their talent for far less scrupulous work. Some highwaymen and robbers are indeed very adept at the use of firearms, and the most skilled of these lowlifes can garner a reputation that borders on legend.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A GUNSLINGER</h4>
			<p>When creating a gunslinger character, think about where your character comes from and their place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your gunslinger. Were you an outlaw forced to run from authority, making you uncomfortably alert in city streets? Or were you a hired gun, taking odd jobs where you could get them, making your own way in an unforgiving world?</p>
			<p class="indent">Why would you take up adventuring? Were you accused of a crime you didn't commit, and now you're searching for answers to clear your name? Are you a bounty hunter, on the trail of a mysterious target? Maybe you just enjoy the fresh air and a night under the stars on a wide open prairie. Any number of things could put your gunslinger character on the road, and any number of them could be true—true enough for an enthralled tavern crowd, anyway.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>Put your highest ability score in Dexterity, then Charisma. You might reverse the two if you intend to take the Phantom Shot archetype. Next, pick the folk hero or criminal backgrounds.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You have access to adrenaline points, which are a pool of energy that you draw from in times of danger. You gain adrenaline points by taking risks and triumphing over your foes. You can then spend adrenaline points to perform ever greater feats of skill, called adrenaline surges.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can have a maximum number of adrenaline points at a time equal to your proficiency bonus. Your pool of adrenaline points resets to zero when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain one adrenaline point when you:</li>
				<li>End your turn within 5 feet of a hostile creature</li>
				<li>Reduce a creature to 0 hit points.</li>
				
				<li>You gain two adrenaline points when you:</li>
				<li>Land a critical hit</li>
				<li>Choose to fail a saving throw against an effect originating from a hostile creature</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At 1st level, you gain two adrenaline surges of your choice. Your surge options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain gunslinger levels, you gain additional surges of your choice, as shown in the Surges Known column of the Gunslinger table</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the surges you know and replace it with another surge that you could learn at that level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some adrenaline surges require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<p class="bold">Adrenaline save DC=</p><p> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			<p>Some adrenaline surges require you to roll a special die, called an adrenaline die. At 1st level, this die is a d4. Your adrenaline die changes when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Adrenaline Die column of the Gunslinger table.</p>

However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don’t die until you run out of adrenaline points, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.</p>
