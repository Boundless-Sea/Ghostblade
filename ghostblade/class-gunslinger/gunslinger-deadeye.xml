            <p>The Deadeye uses cold, calculating aim to eliminate targets from extreme distance. With a safe cushion of distance between themselves and their mark, these snipers train their sights on high-profile targets and slip away before anyone can ascertain what happened. In day-to-day combat, a Deadeye must leverage their ability to retreat to a safe distance, eliminate creatures before they do too much harm to allies, and fend off approaches from crafty opponents.</p>
