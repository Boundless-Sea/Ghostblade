			<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.</p>

This entity finds silent amusement at seeing mortals in peril, and it tends to draw cults of shadowy beings to worship at its altars, performing dark rituals in the name of the Lord of Winds. You have stood before the Storm Lord, unbowed and unbroken, to make a pact that will shake the very fabric of reality. Sparks will leap from your fingertips and fog will rise from your breath as you strike down your enemies with the devastating and majestic power of the Master of the Unfallen Kingdom.</p>
