			<p>At 18th level, you've become so close to death that the ghosts view you as their own, and have learned from you how to fight. When using this feature, you and all haunts take a spectral image of yourself and act on your turn order, mimicing your actions. You can freely swap your position among the spectral images as a free action. The duration of the spectral images is 12s and they will fade away after receiving damage.</p>
