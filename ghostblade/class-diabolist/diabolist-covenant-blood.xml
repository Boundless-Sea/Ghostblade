			<p>Diabolists of the Covenant of Blood wield hemomantic magic. They draw vitality from others to fuel themselves, manipulating the life force of others to their benefit. Of all the covenants, this one could be considered the most "evil" or "unholy", but none can deny the efficacy of diabolists who wield this power----abominable as they might seem on the surface.</p>

			<p>At 7th level, you can feast on the vitality of your foes. As a bonus action while you are corrupted, you can choose creatures up to your Constitution Modifier within 30 feet of you. Each chosen creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw against your Diabolist Spell Save DC, as you draw the life force out of them.</p>
			<p>On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage, but none on a successful saving throw. You then regain hit points equal to half the total necrotic damage dealt (rounded up).</p>

			<p>At 15th level, you have supernatural regeneration that makes defeating you nigh impossible. When you take damage that isn't psychic or radiant, you can use your reaction to regain hit points at the start of your next turn equal to the damage taken. If you are corrupted, the number of hit points you regain isn't reduced as normal.</p>
			<p>You can use this reaction once, and must finish a long rest before doing so again.</p>
